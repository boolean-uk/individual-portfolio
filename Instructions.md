I have designed the portfolio page to simple yet ergonomic in design. From the homepage you can go to the portfolio page, where you will be able to see some examples of my previous projects and individual project. There is also a Contact page, where people can get in touch through Linkedin and by clicking on the email hyperlink. The about me page is a summary of who I am and what I feel I can bring to a team and a summary of my skills. With the home button linking back to the homepage.

I did not take inspiration from any other sources when creating this profile.

I have used HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript in this while constructing it using REACT.
