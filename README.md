# About My Portfolio Project

- Planning & Inspiration (e.g. include drawings, diagrams, links to sites used to get ideas, etc.)
  ~ I used the following portfolios/templates as an initial source of inspiration:
  <https://craig-roush-portfolio-template.webflow.io/>
  <https://www.juliacodes.com/>

- Tech Stack (i.e. what technology / frameworks / libraries you used)
  ~ HTML
  ~ CSS
  ~ JavaScript
  ~ React + React Router

- Why This Stack
  ~ I wanted to use the skills we have been taught so far through this course and felt using all of the above would be a good way to demonstrate what I have learnt.
