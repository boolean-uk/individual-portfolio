You should create your portfolio in a new repo on your own account. But to make it easier for teachers and staff to access your portfolio, please do the following:

✔︎ Fork this repo, and clone the forked version from your GitHub account
✔︎ Rename this README.md file to something else (e.g. INSTRUCTIONS.md)
✔︎ Create a new file called README.md, and include the following content sections (complete them as and when you are able to):
# About My Portfolio Project
## Planning & Inspiration
(e.g. include drawings, diagrams, links to sites used to get ideas, etc.)

## Tech Stack (i.e. what technology / frameworks / libraries you used)
React, Html and CSS

## Why This Stack
I wanted to make full use of what I learnt and apply this knowledge / the feedback I've gotten in the challenges and excercises

## Links

Online Hosted Portfolio
## Portfolio GitHub Repo
https://github.com/AllyDouillette/Rebeccas-individual-portfolio

✔︎  Stage, commit and push your changes; then raise a PR -- as per the usual process
 If any information changes, update it, and push your changes (especially important for the links)
NOTE: We do not want you to use the fork of this repo to host your portfolio project code! Create a new dedicated repo for it from your own account.
