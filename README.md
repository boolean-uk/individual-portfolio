## About my Portfolio

I started with a Miroboard and generally worked up a design. The design was simple with a pretty standard layout. A left menu, header, main, footer. 
I didnt want the webpage to be very colourful but in the Miro board I used bold colours to easily see the general design I wanted to try. My goal here was to create a nonscrolling webpage. I notice it is what is popular nowadays but I felt a page that you navigate around by clicking and not scrolling would be practise for me and I ended up following the Miro board quite closely. 

The CSS was done with lots of effects and colour. I wanted to have a fun page. One day when I am more confident and feel for professional I will make a more sleek and clean cut design. I figured I might as well have fun with this. I dont want to be hired because I am a robot.

## Tech Stack

I used mainly React in this project. I like it because it is a nice mixture of all the skill I have been learning in the first half of this course. I have a JS files holding an array of objects in which I can update with future projects and they populate into the desired area on my website. Otherwise I used my skills in JS, CSS, HTML and NodeJS with React to build this website.
