Tech Stack:
Frontend:
React: I chose React for its component-based architecture, which facilitates the creation of modular and reusable UI components. The virtual DOM and reactive updates align well with the dynamic nature of a portfolio.
Styling:
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS was employed for styling due to its utility-first approach. It allowed for rapid development with pre-defined classes while maintaining the flexibility to customize styles when needed.
Animation Library:
Framer Motion: To incorporate engaging animations seamlessly, Framer Motion was integrated. Its declarative syntax and straightforward implementation made it an ideal choice for adding dynamic elements to the portfolio.
Other Dependencies:
Various React libraries were used for specific functionalities, such as react-icons for including popular icons and react-scroll for smooth scrolling between sections.
Why This Stack:
React:
React's popularity in the frontend development community, along with its robust ecosystem, made it an obvious choice. The ability to build reusable components and manage state efficiently contributed to a more maintainable codebase.

Tailwind CSS:
The utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS allowed for rapid prototyping and styling without the need for extensive custom styles. This expedited the development process while ensuring consistency in design.
